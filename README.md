# RTv1
When it comes to generating 3-dimensional CGI, there are basically two approaches: “Rasterization”, which is the process used by the overwhelming majority of rendering engines for its efficiency, and “Ray Tracing”. ”, A much heavier approach in terms of calculations, therefore not very suitable for real time, but offering an impressive realism.

And then it always makes pretty pictures to show your sweetheart to justify your long hours spent in school rather than in their arms :).
